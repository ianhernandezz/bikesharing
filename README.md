# Overview

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

- It can be seen that there is a huge spike in this graph at the 5 minute mark. The longer the usage the less amount of people are being listed. 


**Check Out Times and Gender**

- As it can be seen, it is divided by gender and it is clear that the males are dominating but a significant amount. 


** Trips by Weekday and Hours**

- This visulization shows the trips by weekday and also the hours of the most action. It can de determined that the early monrings and the afternoons, presumably to work commute and after work commutes, are the most busy hours. 

**Trips by Gender with Weekday and Hours**

![Screen Shot 2022-02-03 at 5 01 49 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92615504/152437977-13867db1-24c0-431f-b763-cfc2ebdd9bd9.png)

- It can be seen that by gender, the males are dominating the usage of the bikes but the females are also using them quite a bit. 


**User Trips with Gender and Weekdays**

![Screen Shot 2022-02-03 at 5 01 54 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92615504/152436670-75f59573-b9aa-4a29-9d8b-efccf783792b.png)

- In this illustartion it can be seen that most of the users are subscribers to the service and again male are dominating it. 

# Summary

After further examining these results, it can be determined that in cities such as NYC, this bike system/program is very popular and effective. It is clear that mostly males are the ones using these methods of transportation. It can be dedused that this system works so well in NYC is because people don't have to own the bikes much less worry about parking since they will be usin the bike. 

**SUGGESTIONS:**

**1.**  Use the data to create a visual that provides the money produced on these bikes to see where possible upgrades can be made to the bikes all togethe to improve ease of use and a better more comfortable experience. 

**2.**  Use the data to create a supply and demand chart to see where are more bikes needed to concentrate where the money making opportunities, but also increase satisfaction of the user as there will be more available in the more dense areas of use. 
 



There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
